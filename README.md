# Home Value Prediction Model

## Model Architecture
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values using mean/mode imputation. Standardized numerical features and one-hot encoded categorical features.
- **Models Used:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used Grid Search for Random Forest.

## Training Process
1. Preprocessed the data.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
4. Performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search for the Random Forest model.
5. Evaluated models using MSE and RÂ² metrics.

## Usage Instructions
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset using the provided preprocessing pipeline.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the model using the training set.
5. Evaluate the model using the testing set.
6. Optionally, fine-tune and validate the model on unseen data.
